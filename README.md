# Quantum-Enhanced Secure Email API

A secure email system implementing **quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms** for enhanced security in the post-quantum era.

---

## üîê Overview

This project provides an API and a minimal **HTML frontend** for secure email communication using **quantum-safe encryption standards**. It includes:

- User authentication (with optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs)
- End-to-end encrypted email exchange
- Wallet-based cryptographic key management
